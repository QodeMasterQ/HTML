           <li>1 Teaespoon of Ground Pepper</li>
           <li>8 Pork Chops</li>
           <li>1 cup of All-Purpose Flour</li>
           <li>Cayenne pepper</li> 
           <li>Season Salt</li>
           <li>1/2 cup of Canola Oil</li>
           <li>1 Tablespoon of Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add seasoning to the pork chops.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour and some cayenne, salt and black pepper.
                 Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, 
                 and then set aside on a plate.</li>
            <li>Heat the canola oil over medium to medium-high heat.
                 Add the butter. When the butter is melted and the 
                 butter/oil mixture is hot, cook 3 pork chops at a time,
                  2 to 3 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook until
                   the chops are golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2
                    minutes (make sure no pink juices remain). Remove to 
                    a plate and repeat with the remaining pork chops.</li>
