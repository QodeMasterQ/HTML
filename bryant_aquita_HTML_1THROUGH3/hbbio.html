<p>My name is Herbert Brown, 2<sup>nd</sup>. I was born in Killen, Texas.
I am 38 years old. I am married to Cassandra Brown and I have two 
children, Y'Sonni, who it 15, and Josiah, who is 11. We live in 
Jackson,MS.</p>

<p>Here's a list of my hobbies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>listening of making music</li>
    <li>cooking</li>
    <li>watching movies</li>
    <li>reading</li>
    <li>learning new things</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as music goes, I love music that people call "<i>Jazz</i>"
, although I <b>HATE</b> that term!<br>Why? Because it is not a term created by the musicians, rather, it
    was created by people who tried to supress and marginalize them.
    I prefer the term "<i>Black American Music</i>", or as Miles Davis calls it,<br>"<b>Social Music.</b>"</p>

<li>Drummers</li>

</ol>
<p>I also love sports! The Dallas <b>COWGIRLS</b>, Los Angeles Lakers
    , Los Angles Dodgers, and Edmonton Oilers.</p>

<p>As you can see, I have a lot of interests. One of my mantras in life is:</p>
<blockquote>Everyday I wake up, I have the same opportunity as 
    everyone else to either make a wise decision or a foolish one,
    to learn something new, or let my mind be idle, to love or hate.
    It is all a matter of choice that seperates the successful from 
    the unsuccessful.</blockquote>
    <p><i>p.s.</i>, I didn't get that quote from anyone. I made it up on my own.</p>
