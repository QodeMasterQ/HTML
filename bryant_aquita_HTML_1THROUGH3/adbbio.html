<p>My name is Aquita D. Bryant, the D is for Distinguished Delt... never mind,
    give me a year or two before I release that type of information. I was born in Jackson,MS.
I am 22 years young. I am not married to Chris Brown but we are engageD, 
I do not have any children but I plan on having no more than 3 (Payton, Baileigh, and Silver Noel).
I am Saints fan, I bleed black and gold, but don't cut me because my daddy
bought me a gun so I'm a licensed carrier.</p>

<p>As you can see, I have a lot of interests. One of my mantras in life is:</p>
<blockquote>"You have brians in your head.<br>You have feet in your shoes.<br>You 
    can steer yourself<br>any direction you choose.<br> You're on your own
    and you know <br>what you know <br>And YOU are the guy who'll decide <br>where
    to go.
    .</blockquote>
    <p><i>p.s.</i>, I didn't get that quote from anyone. I made it up on my own.<br>
    Just kidding, that came from the Dr. Suess book <i>"Oh the Places You Will Go."</I></p>
